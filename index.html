        <h1>Australia's Suicide Rate</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Deaths by suicide are statistically and relatively rare events. However, every life lost to suicide is a tragedy and the impacts on family, friends and communities are profound. It can have devastating and long-lasting effects on those left behind. Although suicide and intentional self-harm are complex issues, they can be prevented. (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2021)</p>

      <h2>Suicide Rates across States and Territories</h2>
      <p>Following the population growth, the suicide rates increased generally across Australia from 1995 to 2015.</p>
      <p>Along those years, the suicide rates were always the highest in the Northern Territory. It reached a peak at 28.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2007. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the suicide rates tended to be lower in Victoria, New South Wales, and Australian Capital Territory. The lowest rate is 5.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2005 in Australian Capital Territory.</p>

      <h2>Suicide Rates by Gender</h2>
      <p>From 1921 to 2015, the suicide rates ranged from 8.4 deaths per 100,000 population per year in 1943 to 18.4 in 1963. Along those years, males always have higher suicide rates than females, with several peaks around 1930 and 1960s. The highest rate for males is 29.8 deaths per 100,000 population in 1930. The highest rate for females is 13.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 1965.
